I see that messy, long black hair; outwards lips; outstrut nose; a tall lanky boy, an Asian one, a Taiwanese one. I see those physical features and feel more distance from the ideal but more kinship with the Asian-American. I see my face, I recognize my face. I thought I’d look brave. Maybe a later day. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> When David Mura visited our class, he told me to love my body, “especially as an Asian-American male”. It was difficult to bring those words into my soul, to embrace them. I have always been wary of doing things motivated by my identity as a man, because it’s come to seem that there is no such thing as “toxic masculinity”. It seems that all masculinity, all gendered associations, are either emotionally laborious to the self or harmful to others. </p> <div class="graphic"> </div> <div class="graphic"> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Some “masculine” qualities, such as being assertive or rational or liking sports, are of course not harmful in themselves. But if you need to <i>be</i> something to <i>be</i> a man, then that something is more often than not disingenuously forced out, and also collectively harmful to those who are unable to meet that. It is the pressuring to do acts associated with manhood, not the acts themselves, that is toxic. </p> <div class="graphic"> </div> <div class="graphic"> </div> <div class="graphic"> </div> <p class="dinkus g-body paragraph"> *** </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The image in my head of the ideal man has always been tall, athletic, confident, cool, dominant, and more often than not White. I think I’ve always subconsciously avoided those types — I don’t have any friends like that. I’m not sure why. I just get nervous. I forget how to act. I feign coolness. I shed my entire personality for a more relaxed tone. I start to call people around me “man”. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> That’s why it was refreshing to see sexy Asian men in <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, as I don’t usually see Asian men with those bodies in the mainstream. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <a href="undefined"> <img src="chris-pang.7e1f87fe.jpg"> </a> <p class="image-caption-text"> Chris Pang plays Colin Khoo in the film. </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I appreciated the example. It taught me that I need not listen to the voices saying Asian male bodies were not attractive. The film probably did make many of its other viewers question why they held, expected, or were satisfied by particular media archetypes of Asian people in the first place. But did I have to look and act like Colin Khoo to love my body? </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a22674130/crazy-rich-asians-cast-representation/"><i>Men’s Health </i></a><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a22674130/crazy-rich-asians-cast-representation/">article</a> from which I found the above image opens like so: </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <span class="blockquote">Chris Pang started working out for a common reason: to get the girl. But his motives are a lot deeper than that now.<br>…<br>In <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, [Adele] Lim and co-writer Peter Chiarelli deliberately set out to depict Asian men as sexy and masculine. The movie seeks to accomplish this not by delving into serious subject matter like <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> (the last mainstream Hollywood movie to feature a mostly Asian cast), but by emphasizing the joy of being Asian — and, in the case of Pang and Golding, the joy of being an attractive, fit Asian man.<br>“[The movie shows] Asian men and the masculinity of Asian men, without needing to overdo it or overcompensating, without being heavy-handed,” says Ronny Chieng, who plays one of the film’s antagonists, Edison Cheng.</span> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I truly understand the sentiment. As someone situated in my body, however, I wonder whether Asian masculinity uproots White masculinity, or substitutes it, replacing it with an ideal similarly harmful at its core. A central aspect of masculinity is the positioning of one kind of male over another, like White men over men of color or heterosexual men over homosexual men. For Asian men and women, this domination has occurred through both asexualization and hyper-feminization (as opposed to the hyper-masculinization of Black men and women).<cite>Takinami</cite> In <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> I saw an example of Asian masculinity that seems to rival White masculinity. But it reminded me of how I felt in history class when teachers lectured on the negative stereotypes that faced Asian male immigrants: they were diseased; they were corrupt; they were <i>effeminate</i>. Effeminacy was always treated as an insult. On Google, the word’s definition is literally stamped with the <span id="derogatory"> DEROGATORY </span> box. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <a href="undefined"> <img src="effeminate.59d7a396.png"> </a> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In understanding as derogatory what the White man called the Asian-American man, and in trying to protest it with another form of masculinity, it seemed the Asian-American man was reproducing the same mechanism of power and control that has been used to subordinate them. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> As I insinuate that I think masculinity always has to subordinate others, I then must answer this: Who are the <i>Crazy Rich Asians </i>men, by being Asian but also hot and muscular, subordinating? </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> What first comes to mind is that, within the Chinese-American community, a clearly subjugated identity is homosexuality. Homosexuality is tabboo in my house, and I get the sense that it is broadly in Taiwan as well, though I don’t much about Taiwan. But I don’t think the intermale stigmatization that homophobia represents can be attributed, at least not much, to the “protest masculinity” that Asian-American men develop in America. Homophobia has its own fuel in the East.<cite>Eng</cite> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> One of the only Asian men I know to look up to is 爸爸. But he grew up in Taiwan, and his ideas of manhood probably weren’t formed, or affected as much, in the United States. Thus I turn to <i>Chan is Missing</i> to try to better understand Asian-American masculinity. Early on in the film, we see signs that Steve’s cultural displacement — born in America in a Chinese body — has made him aggressive in his American identity. </p> <div class="undefined video-container"> <video controls class="video" preload="metadata"> <source src="pants.8b4428fe.mp4"> </video> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> That overt confidence, that mockery, that putting down of people more Chinese than you out of your own insecurity — those are some sure markers of American masculinity. As Peter Feng writes<cite>Feng</cite> in “Being Chinese American, Becoming Asian American”: </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <span class="blockquote">Steve’s references to combat in Vietnam, not to mention his repeated use of the interjection "man," hint at the threat to his masculine identity posed by Chan Hung. Chan Hung's inability to assimilate threatens Steve's perception of himself as American and as a man. (104)</span> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> But this form of masculinity is different from the one in <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>. Steve has directly adopted a White form of masculinity — the one that puts down Asian men — in an attempt to feel more secure about the instability of his own identity. In <i>Crazy RIch Asians</i>, I believe, the writers hoped to replace White masculinity with an Asian-American kind of masculinity. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Could Asian-American masculinity simply be a necessary form of resistance? Can Asian-American masculinity in the media co-exist with the need to rid myself of masculinity? I wrote in my <a href="https://jsonkao.github.io/diaspora-puddle/">midterm essay</a> that representation is indispensable, but inadequate. I feel the need to amend that to be, representation is indispensable <i>and</i> inadequate. The changed word implies that representation may not be an ideal that is “necessary but flawed”. It is necessary to break down harmful cultural ideas, yes. But that is a deconstruction that must coexist with a building-up process in which Asian males learn to look to something other than masculinity. Indispensable <i>and</i> inadequate. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> But if Chris Pang is shirtless in theaters everywhere, does that allow sufficient space for the building-up of Asian-American males? I remember in the seventh grade I was really into the K-pop group NU’EST. I would watch their performances and reality show episodes all the time. </p> <div class="g-body graphic"> <iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MwlKalNwGdk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p class="caption" style="color:#121212">I could do this dance!</p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though he never directly said it, I could tell that 爸爸 could get a bit uncomfortable with my K-pop phase. There was one NU’EST member in particular that he disapproved of: Ren. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <a href="undefined"> <img src="ren.94540ba0.png"> </a> <div class="undefined video-container"> <video controls class="video" preload="metadata"> <source src="dance.29921208.mp4"> </video> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> One day he asked me, “Why does he dress like a girl?” — no direct disapproval, but it’s in the subtext. At this point in my life, I wanted to be like K-pop stars and their fans. I would try to stylize myself like the stars. (Whenever I’d come back from the barber, my parents would always be confused as to why I didn’t cut my hair shorter.) I learned the dances, to which my parents were supportive. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Asian-American men who are strong both physically and emotionally always stand out to me in films and TV. In the show <i>Insecure</i>, the Asian man’s body has never been involved in some sexless joke. He is strong, he is not intimidated in his relationships, he is not afraid to say what he wants. He has sex scenes 🤯 that are not part of a joke 🤯 and are sexual and explicit 🤯. </p> <div class="undefined video-container"> <video controls class="video" preload="metadata"> <source src="Insecure2x04.2d1be969.mp4"> </video> <p class="caption paragraph">Source: “<a href="https://www.provokr.com/tv/sexiest-scenes-of-insecure/">SEXIEST SCENES OF INSECURE</a>” by Georgia Davis in <i>Provokr</i>.</p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Lilting</i> suddenly comes to mind. When I first saw the film, I didn’t know what to think of it. I was only looking at it through the narrow lens of race. I formed some shallow thoughts about the language differences, and how some messages were lost in translation. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> A central point in Feng Cheng’s thesis “Constructing a New Asian Masculinity: Reading <i>Lilting</i> Against Other Films by Asian Filmmakers”<cite>Cheng</cite> is that masculinity in the film </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Richard does not fit the trope of Americans performatively boasting their ability to use chopsticks. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Cheng’s ideas made me realize that the reason that the meanings in <i>Lilting </i>had escaped me during my first viewing was that the identities and people in the film were so fluid, so porous. </p> <p class="dinkus g-body paragraph"> *** </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I have the utmost respect for everyone who enabled me to sit and ruminate today: Professor Handal, who manifested this class; my classmates, who inspire me every week; my parents, who are my foundation, my earth; this apartment that is quiet and warm; my friends who make me feel full enough to give myself to this page. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In inquiring the self, we learn directly about the self, and people, and society. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I have so much respect and love for those who taught me to, with my great privilege of four years’ time, look up and look within. To think and question and search. But also I must, I must — I must recognize what is around me, and act. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I am writing this on April 12, 2021. It’s been one day. I am tired of saying the names. Each one carries a deep well of sadness. All I should say here is that today is April 12, 2021. It’s been one day. It’s been two weeks. It’s been, it’s been, it’s been. I feel forced to say a name. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <span class="blockquote"><i>Things I’m going to say, not shout.</i></span> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Daunte Wright. It’s been one day. Today is April 12, 2021. It’s been one day. It’s also been two weeks. It’s also been four weeks. It’s been, it’s been. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <span class="blockquote"><i>Nobody asked me to. Especially not those for whom it is intended. — Frantz Fanon</i></span> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> An Asian-American professor I highly admire recently told me, “[Identity searching is] a process and once you find your place and are comfortable with who you are in your many different surroundings, your purpose will become much clearer.” </p> <p class="dinkus g-body paragraph"> *** </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I wonder how successful Crazy Rich Asians would have been if the main cast spoke with Chinese accents instead of the Received English. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Sometimes it’s entertaining to talk in a British accent. But sometimes it’s sickening in the afterthought. The fact that It’s not a symptom, but a marker, of inferiority, of colonization — a pretty equivalent term, though with different connotations in public opinion, is white supremacy. (I say “close” because the terms are too large to be equated, and as such they have different connotations in the public sphere. I don’t say “close” because I think they are different, only because I don’t think I have a full understanding of the two words.) Where does my deep rooted disgust, or fear, come from? I know many immigrants who hope to strip themselves of their Chinese accent as soon as possible. Frantz Fanon studies this phenomenon in the first chapter of <i>Black Skin, White Masks</i>, “The Black Man and Language”: </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <span class="blockquote">All colonized people —in other words, people in whom an inferiority complex has taken root, whose local cultural originality has been committed to the grave—position themselves in relation to the civilizing language: i.e., the metropolitan culture. The more the colonized has assimilated the cultural values of the metropoli, the more he will have escaped the bush. The more he rejects his blackness and the bush, the whiter he will become.</span> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Of course, it’s tied to my forced laughter when Asian-American comics make dehumanizing comments in an attempt to be the cool Asian kid who can laugh at racist jokes. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Like when Ronny Chieng perpetuates the stereotypes that Asians are emotionless, obedient work animals. (I would love to write a rant about the times when Ronny Chieng fronts as disarming Asian stereotypes but actually forwards and strengthens; but this isn’t the place). </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I see in Ken Jeong’s face the pain of having been that for America. The pain of his Leslie Chow character will lie in history synonymous with Fu Manchu or Charlie Chan: “They’ll throw water at <i>Chow</i> any time.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I’ve seen him play it off at his Netflix special. He says of the criticism from Asian-American fans that they should be proud of him for representing them, for beating up three of “the white man”. He mentions the only criticism one could refute — Asian-American teenage boys who think they can’t sleep with white women because of the small dick stereotype. </p> <p class="dinkus g-body paragraph"> *** </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Professor Manan Ahmed, at a conference he made for his Contemporary Civilization class, said: </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <span class="blockquote">Part of what I learned today is precisely how important it is for us to do this act of reading, this act of thinking. But, not isolated. Not an Ivy League person in a text.
