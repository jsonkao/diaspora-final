I see that messy, long black hair; outwards lips; outstrut nose; a tall lanky boy, an Asian one, a Taiwanese one. I see those physical features and feel more distance from the ideal but more kinship with the Asian-American. I see my face, I recognize my face. I thought I’d look brave. Maybe a later day. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> When David Mura visited our class, he told me to love my body, “especially as an Asian-American male”. It was difficult at first to bring those words into my soul, to embrace them, as I have always been wary of doing things motivated by my identity as a man. Because it’s come that masculinity, all gendered associations, are either emotionally laborious to the self or harmful to others. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="mapping" data="{&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;mapping.html&quot;,&quot;left&quot;:&quot;stoic, firm, tough, boys don’t cry&quot;,&quot;right&quot;:&quot;denying weakness, denying emotion, mental health epidemic&quot;}"> </div> </div> <div class="graphic"> <div class="mapping" data="{&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;mapping.html&quot;,&quot;left&quot;:&quot;powerful, formidable, commanding, provider&quot;,&quot;right&quot;:&quot;violent, subjugating all who are not the “ideal man”: gay, trans, feminine, woman, poor&quot;}"> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Some “masculine” qualities, such as being assertive or rational or liking sports, are of course not harmful in themselves. But if you need to <i>be</i> something to <i>be</i> a man, then that something is more often than not disingenuously forced out, and also collectively harmful to those who are unable to meet that. It is the pressuring to do acts associated with manhood, not the acts themselves, that is toxic. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="mapping" data="{&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;mapping.html&quot;,&quot;left&quot;:&quot;rational&quot;,&quot;right&quot;:&quot;hyperrational, unsympathetic&quot;}"> </div> </div> <div class="graphic"> <div class="mapping" data="{&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;mapping.html&quot;,&quot;left&quot;:&quot;strong&quot;,&quot;right&quot;:&quot;another mental health epidemic, body image issues, not fat, not skinny, not short, probably not Asian-American&quot;}"> </div> </div> <div class="graphic"> <div class="mapping" data="{&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;mapping.html&quot;,&quot;left&quot;:&quot;caretaker, compassionate, listener&quot;,&quot;right&quot;:&quot;doesn’t need to be just about men anymore, so why is it?&quot;}"> </div> </div> <p class="dinkus g-body paragraph"> *** </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The image in my head of the ideal man has always been tall, athletic, confident, cool, dominant, and more often than not White. I think I’ve always subconsciously avoided those types — I don’t have any friends like that. I’m not sure why. I just get nervous. I forget how to act. I feign coolness. I shed my entire personality for a more relaxed tone. I start to call people around me “man”. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> That’s why it was refreshing to see sexy Asian men in <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, as I don’t usually see Asian men with those bodies in the mainstream. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <a href="undefined"> <img src="chris-pang.7e1f87fe.jpg"> </a> <p class="image-caption-text"> Chris Pang plays Colin Khoo in the film. </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I appreciated the example. It taught me that I need not listen to the voices saying Asian male bodies were not attractive. The film probably did make many of its other viewers question why they held, expected, or were satisfied by particular media archetypes of Asian people in the first place. But did I have to look and act like Colin Khoo to love my body? </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a22674130/crazy-rich-asians-cast-representation/"><i>Men’s Health </i></a><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a22674130/crazy-rich-asians-cast-representation/">article</a> from which I found the above image opens like so: </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <span class="blockquote">Chris Pang started working out for a common reason: to get the girl. But his motives are a lot deeper than that now.<br>…<br>In <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, [Adele] Lim and co-writer Peter Chiarelli deliberately set out to depict Asian men as sexy and masculine. The movie seeks to accomplish this not by delving into serious subject matter like <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> (the last mainstream Hollywood movie to feature a mostly Asian cast), but by emphasizing the joy of being Asian — and, in the case of Pang and Golding, the joy of being an attractive, fit Asian man.<br>“[The movie shows] Asian men and the masculinity of Asian men, without needing to overdo it or overcompensating, without being heavy-handed,” says Ronny Chieng, who plays one of the film’s antagonists, Edison Cheng.</span> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> I truly understand the sentiment. As someone situated in my body, however, I wonder whether Asian masculinity uproots White masculinity, or substitutes it, replacing it with an ideal similarly harmful at its core. A central aspect of masculinity is the positioning of one kind of male over another, like White men over men of color or heterosexual men over homosexual men. For Asian men and women, this domination has occurred through both asexualization and hyper-feminization (as opposed to the hyper-masculinization of Black men and women).<cite>Takinami</cite> In <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> I saw an example of Asian masculinity that seems to rival White masculinity. But it reminded me of how I felt in history class when teachers lectured on the negative stereotypes that faced Asian male immigrants: they were diseased; they were corrupt; they were <i>effeminate</i>. Effeminacy was always treated as an insult. On Google, the word’s definition is literally stamped with the <span id="derogatory"> DEROGATORY </span> box. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <a href="undefined"> <img src="effeminate.59d7a396.png"> </a> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In understanding as derogatory what the White man called the Asian-American man, and in trying to protest it with another form of masculinity, it seemed the Asian-American man was reproducing the same mechanism of power and control that has been used to subordinate them. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> As I insinuate that I think masculinity always has to subordinate others, I then must answer this: Who are the <i>Crazy Rich Asians </i>men, by being Asian but also hot and muscular, subordinating? </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> What first comes to mind is that, within the Chinese-American community, a clearly subjugated identity is homosexuality. Homosexuality is tabboo in my house, and I get the sense that it is broadly in Taiwan as well, though I don’t much about Taiwan. But I don’t think the intermale stigmatization that homophobia represents can be attributed, at least not much, to the “protest masculinity” that Asian-American men develop in America. Homophobia has its own fuel in the East.<cite>Eng</cite> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> One of the only Asian men I know to look up to is 爸爸. But he grew up in Taiwan, and his ideas of manhood probably weren’t formed, or affected as much, in the United States. Thus I turn to <i>Chan is Missing</i> to try to better understand Asian-American masculinity. Early on in the film, we see signs that Steve’s cultural displacement — born in America in a Chinese body — has made him aggressive in his American identity. </p> <div class="undefined video-container"> <video controls class="video" preload="metadata"> <source src="pants.8b4428fe.mp4"> </video> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> That overt confidence, that mockery, that putting down of people more Chinese than you out of your own insecurity — those are some sure markers of American masculinity. As Peter Feng writes<cite>Feng</cite> in “Being Chinese American, Becoming Asian American”: </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <span class="blockquote">Steve’s references to combat in Vietnam, not to mention his repeated use of the interjection "man," hint at the threat to his masculine identity posed by Chan Hung. Chan Hung's inability to assimilate threatens Steve's perception of himself as American and as a man. (104)</span> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> But this form of masculinity is different from the one in <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>. Steve has directly adopted a White form of masculinity — the one that puts down Asian men — in an attempt to feel more secure about the instability of his own identity. In <i>Crazy RIch Asians</i>, I believe, the writers hoped to replace White masculinity with an Asian-American kind of masculinity. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Could Asian-American masculinity simply be a necessary form of resistance? Can Asian-American masculinity in the media co-exist with my feeling of needing to rid myself of masculinity? I wrote in my <a href="https://jsonkao.github.io/diaspora-puddle/">midterm essay</a> that representation is indispensable, but inadequate. I feel the need to amend that to be, representation is indispensable <i>and</i> inadequate. The changed word implies that representation may not be an ideal that is “necessary but flawed”. It is necessary to break down harmful cultural ideas, yes. But that is a deconstruction that must coexist with a building-up process in which Asian males learn to look to something other than masculinity. Indispensable <i>and</i> inadequate. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> But if Chris Pang is shirtless in theaters everywhere, does that allow sufficient space for the building-up of Asian-American males? I remember in the seventh grade I was really into the K-pop group NU’EST. I would watch their performances and reality show episodes all the time. </p> <div class="g-body graphic"> <iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MwlKalNwGdk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p class="caption" style="color:#121212">I could do this dance!</p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though he never directly said it, I could tell that 爸爸 could get a bit uncomfortable with my K-pop phase. There was one NU’EST member in particular that he disapproved of: Ren. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <a href="undefined"> <img src="ren.94540ba0.png"> </a> <div class="undefined video-container"> <video controls class="video" preload="metadata"> <source src="dance.29921208.mp4"> </video> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> One day he asked me, “Why does he dress like a girl?” — no direct disapproval, but it’s in the subtext. At this point in my life, I wanted to be like K-pop stars and their fans. I would try to stylize myself like the stars. (Whenever I’d come back from the barber, my parents would always be confused as to why I didn’t cut my hair shorter.) I learned the dances, to which my parents were supportive. But I don’t think Chris Pang’s body would resolve the tensions between father and K-pop sons. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Nevertheless, Asian-American men who are strong both physically and emotionally always stand out to me in films and TV. In the show <i>Insecure</i>, the Asian man’s body has never been involved in some sexless joke. He is strong, he is not intimidated in his relationships, he is not afraid to say what he wants. He has sex scenes 🤯 that are not part of a joke 🤯 and are sexual and explicit 🤯. </p> <div class="undefined video-container"> <video controls class="video" preload="metadata"> <source src="Insecure2x04.2d1be969.mp4"> </video> <p class="caption paragraph">Source: “<a href="https://www.provokr.com/tv/sexiest-scenes-of-insecure/">SEXIEST SCENES OF INSECURE</a>” by Georgia Davis in <i>Provokr</i>.</p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Lilting</i> suddenly comes to mind. When I first saw the film, I didn’t know what to think of it. I was only looking at it through the narrow lens of race and cultural differences. I formed some shallow thoughts about the language barriers, and how some messages were lost in translation. It wasn’t until I reached this point in my writing that I realized the careful messaging about masculinity and fluidity. In his thesis thesis “Constructing a New Asian Masculinity: Reading <i>Lilting</i> Against Other Films by Asian Filmmakers”<cite>Cheng</cite>, Feng Cheng writes of <i>Lilting</i> that: </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <span class="blockquote">masculinity is not envisioned to be a coveted quality that attaches to other attributes (most conspicuously, race.) Rather, it flows from character to character, and this is made possible by the porousness of the familiar categories: race, sexuality, etc. As a matter of fact, it could be argued that the film does not even acknowledge masculinity as a trait that is desirable, because it is not in anyway linked with power, prestige or even social acceptance.
