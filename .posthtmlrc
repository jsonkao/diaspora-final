For Asian men and women, this domination has occurred through both asexualization and hyper-feminization (as opposed to the hyper-masculinization of Black men and women).<cite>Takinami</cite> In <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> I saw an example of Asian masculinity that seems to rival White masculinity. But it reminded me of how I felt in history class when teachers lectured on the negative stereotypes that faced Asian male immigrants: they were diseased; they were corrupt; they were <i>effeminate</i>. Effeminacy was always treated as an insult. On Google, the word’s definition is literally stamped with the <span id=\"derogatory\"> DEROGATORY </span> box."
